## 🌍 Project Overview  

This project was created as part of our first-year studies. It builds upon an existing demo version of **EuroTrip** and aims to provide an engaging yet simple gaming experience.  

### 🎯 Vision  

The goal is to create a game that is easy to play with simple rules, yet offers enough challenge to make it interesting. The player’s objective is to:  

- **Travel to five of the largest cities in Europe** (each with an airport and a population of at least 1,000,000).  
- **Alternatively, locate five of the busiest airports in Europe** (excluding Istanbul, as its airports are in Asia).  

To succeed, players must find the correct airports and plan the shortest possible routes between them.
